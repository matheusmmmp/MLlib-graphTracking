## ✎About

This notebook is a form to practice my knowledge in data science, mostly with the **MLlib library in PySpark**. It walks us through a workflow for solving a transportation problem with a Graph Theory.

The main purpose of this notebook is to serve as a step-by-step workflow guide, allowing me to review this notebook myself and serve as a study for future cases.

This notebook was developed within the databricks environment [DataBricks](https://www.databricks.com/).
